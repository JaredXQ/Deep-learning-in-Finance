# Deep-learning-in-Finance

I applied forward feeding network(DNN) and CNN model to NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) market data. This is my first experience combining deep learning methods and finance data. The coding part uses python and keras framework. 

And i wrote an IEEE format paper talking about the method i used and some explanation about it.
