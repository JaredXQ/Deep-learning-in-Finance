# Deep-learning-in-Finance
Applied Deep learning model in Financial market.
I applied forward feeding network(DNN) and CNN model to NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) market data. This is my first experience combining deep learning method and finance market. The coding part uses python and keras framework.
